# Node.js Worker Threads vs Cluster

This README explains the differences between the Worker Threads and Cluster modules in Node.js through the provided examples. <span style="color:red;">This file is an AI-generated content.</span>

## Worker Threads Example

### Key Points:

1. **Purpose:** Worker Threads are designed for parallel execution of JavaScript code in a single Node.js instance by creating separate threads.
2. **Execution Model:** The main thread spawns a worker thread to handle tasks, enabling concurrent execution.
3. **Use Case:** Suitable for CPU-intensive tasks, such as computations or data processing, while keeping the main thread responsive.
4. **Communication:** Main and worker threads communicate using messages (via `postMessage` and `onmessage`).

## Cluster Module Example

### Key Points:

1. **Purpose:** The Cluster module is used to create multiple Node.js processes that share the same server port, leveraging multi-core systems.
2. **Execution Model:** A primary process forks worker processes. Each worker is a full Node.js process.
3. **Use Case:** Ideal for I/O-intensive tasks (e.g., HTTP servers) to maximize CPU utilization across all cores.
4. **Communication:** Workers and the primary process communicate using IPC (Inter-Process Communication).

## Comparison

| Feature             | Worker Threads                     | Cluster Module                           |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Execution Model** | Multi-threading within one process | Multi-processing with separate instances |
| **Use Case**        | CPU-bound tasks                    | I/O-bound tasks, scaling HTTP servers    |
| **Communication**   | Message passing                    | IPC channels                             |
| **Resource Usage**  | Lower                              | Higher (separate processes)              |
| **Port Sharing**    | Not applicable                     | Allows sharing server ports              |

### Summary

-   Use **Worker Threads** when you need to handle CPU-intensive tasks without blocking the main thread.
-   Use **Cluster Module** when you want to scale an I/O-intensive application across multiple CPU cores.
